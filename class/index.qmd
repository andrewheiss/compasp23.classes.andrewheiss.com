Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete ***before*** class.

You should also write and submit a [weekly reading report](/assignment/reading-report.qmd) on iCollege, due the day before class.

## References

You can access [a shared group Zotero library of all the class reading references](https://www.zotero.org/groups/compasp23) and link it to your Zotero account to easily cite the course materials. 

Alternatively, you can download a BibTeX file of all the references. You can open it in [BibDesk on macOS](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/), [JabRef on Windows](http://www.jabref.org/), or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) on macOS, Windows, and online.
