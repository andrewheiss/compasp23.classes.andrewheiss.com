## OLS (straight lines): Life expectancy explained by government effectiveness

Here's what the relationship between government effectivenss and life expectancy looks like

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(vdem_2015, aes(x = govt_effectiveness, y = life_exp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Interactive plot:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(vdem_2015, aes(x = govt_effectiveness, y = life_exp)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point(aes(text = country_name))

ggplotly(p1, tooltip = "all")
```


We can make a regression model to find the slope of that line:

```{r}
model_ols <- lm(life_exp ~ govt_effectiveness, data = vdem_2015)
tidy(model_ols)
```

## Logistic regression (curvy lines + binary outcomes): Impartial PA explained by government effectiveness

Here's what the relationship between government effectiveness and impartial public administration looks like:

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(vdem_2015, aes(x = govt_effectiveness, y = impartial_num)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

That line goes beyond 100% after 1ish (so there's something like a 120% chance of impartial public administration when government effectiveness is 2).

Instead, we can use logistic regression to force the predictions to stay between 0 and 1

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(vdem_2015, aes(x = govt_effectiveness, y = impartial_num)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = binomial(link = "logit")))
```

This works by converting the outcome to log odds and drawing a straight line through that:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://bayesf22-notebook.classes.andrewheiss.com/bayes-rules/13-chapter_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png")
```

Here's the regression model:

```{r}
model_logit <- glm(impartial ~ govt_effectiveness, 
                   data = vdem_2015, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
# Log odds
tidy(model_logit)
```

Those values make no sense on their own. We can inverse logit the intercept to find the proportion of countries with impartial PA when government effectiveness is 0:

```{r}
plogis(1.797934)
```

But that's about all we can easily get from this table. We can't really talk about the slope without working with some fancy algebra.

We can convert these log odds into something called an odds ratio by exponentiating them (or unlogging them), like $e^{2.120909}$:

```{r}
exp(2.120909)
```

```{r}
# Odds ratios
tidy(model_logit, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

That means that a 1 unit change in government effectiveness makes it 8.3 times more likely to have impartial governance. Neat.

But that's still weird. We want changes in probabilities, not relative changes in likelihood.

Getting one single probability-scale slope is impossble thoughâ€”the slope changes across the whole range of government effectiveness. We can plot the predicted probabilities to see that:

```{r}
plot_predictions(model_logit, condition = "govt_effectiveness")
```

We can find the instantaneous slope at any level of government effectiveness. This is also called a "marginal effect". For instance, here's the slope of that line when government effectiveness is -1, 0, and 1. 

```{r}
slopes(model_logit, newdata = datagrid(govt_effectiveness = c(-1, 0, 1)))
```

These are all percentage point changes. If you're currently at -1, a 1 unit increase in government effectiveness is associated with a 52 percentage point increase in the probability of haivng impartial PA. That's huge!

If you're currently at 1, a 1 unit increase in government effectiveness is only associated with a 4 percentage point increase in the probability of having impartial PA. That's not huge!

The effect of government effectiveness is thus more important or powerful in countries with low effectiveness. Reforms matter a lot there.


## Ordered logistic regression (curvy lines + ordered categorical outcomes): Impartial PA explained by government effectiveness

We cheated a little with that impartial public administration outcome before. In the Varieties of Democracy data, impartial PA is actually a 5-category ordered categorical variable with these levels:

- 0: The law is not respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is rampant.
- 1: The law is weakly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is widespread.
- 2: The law is modestly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is moderate.
- 3: The law is mostly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is limited.
- 4: The law is generally fully respected by the public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is very limited.

To make it binary before, I collapsed the values so that 0-1 = false and 2-4 = true. But that gets rid of interesting variation in the outcome! 

We can use ordered logistic regression to model the effect of government effectiveness on the level of impartiality. 

Ordered logistic regression is a fancier version of regular logistic regression. Conceptually, instead of just working with a binary outcome (not impartial vs. impartial), we work with a bunch of outcomes that we force to be binary-ish (0 vs. 1-4, 0-1 vs. 2-4, 0-2 vs. 3-4, 0-3 vs. 4)

This gets really complex and graphs help a lot!

Here's the model:

```{r message=FALSE}
model_ologit <- polr(impartial_ord ~ govt_effectiveness, data = vdem_2015)
tidy(model_ologit)
```

All those weird 0|1, 1|2, etc. things are called cutpoints and they show the underlying probability of having a 0 vs. 1-4, 0-1 vs. 2-4, and so on. They're on the log odds scale, and because they're a kind of intercept, so we can un-log-odds them with `plogis()`:

```{r message=FALSE}
tidy(model_ologit) %>%
  filter(term != "govt_effectiveness") %>%
  mutate(estimate = plogis(estimate))
```

We have a coefficient for government effectiveness, but it's a log odds value and who even knows what that means. For mathy reasons, we can't just feed it to `plogis()` to get probability-level values. We can exponentiate it ($e^{2.5227}$:

```{r message=FALSE}
tidy(model_ologit, exponentiate = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(term == "govt_effectiveness")
```

But that's still hard to think about. A 1 unit increase in government effectiveness makes it 12 times more likely to move up a level in the 0-4 scale? Or something? That's weird.

Instead, we can work with predicted values and marginal effects like we did before with regular logistic regression.

Here's what the probability of having different levels of impartial PA looks like across the whole range of government effectiveness:

```{r message=FALSE}
plot_predictions(model_ologit, 
                 condition = c("govt_effectiveness", "group"), 
                 type = "probs")
```

That's so cool! (And it's the same kind of graph that's in Figure 3 in the Suzuki and Hur article)

We can find the exact slope of each of those lines at different levels of government effectiveness. Here are the slopes when government effectiveness is -1, 0, and 1:

```{r message=FALSE}
slopes(model_ologit, newdata = datagrid(govt_effectiveness = c(-1, 0, 1)))
```
