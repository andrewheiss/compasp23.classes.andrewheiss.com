You will select one specific concept, theoretical framework, mechanism, or hypothesis from the class readings and discussions (e.g quality of government and economic development, gender representation and level of corruption, how to measure the quality of government, the relationship between civil society and political regimes, etc.) and select 2â€“3 readings related to the topic from the course readings. 

You will summarize and synthesize the main arguments of the selected readings and then select one specific real world event or case that may or may not fit with the concept, theoretical framework, mechanism, or hypothesis that you chose. You'll conclude with a discussion of how the theories and concepts you chose help or fail to help explain the issue you selected and provide a new perspective, shed light on a neglected issue, or provide potential solutions.

Broadly speaking, your essay should include:

- Main idea of your chosen concept, theoretical framework, mechanism, or hypothesis
- Specific real world issue or case
- Discussion of the relevance of the concept, theoretical framework, mechanism, or hypothesis to your selected issue 

You will submit this essay via iCollege.

I will grade this with a rubric that I will provide later.
